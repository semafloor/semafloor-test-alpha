                To start with, this section will briefly introduce Semafloor, just another Progressive Web App or PWA for short built with a bunch of goodies and bleeding edge web technologies such as Web Components.
                Well, there are even more contents to be explained in more details at later sections.
                So, just bear with me, as things will be simple, straightforward and much understandable here. Without further ado, let's dive in.
              </p>
              <h2>What is Progressive Web App?</h2>
              <p>
                There are some requirements for a Progressive Web App to fulfill:
                <ul>
                  <li><span>Responsive</span> - Fit in any kind of form factor, be it a desktop or a mobile device. The web app will transform and will react to the different sizes.</li>
                  <li><span>Connectivity independent</span> - With the power of Service Worker, a web app can now work both online and offline regardless of the quality of the network connectivity.</li>
                  <li><span>Safe</span> - As Service Worker embraces HTTPS, all content must be served via secured connection to prevent snooping and ensure content hasn't been tampered with.</li>
                  <li><span>Installable</span> - Allow users to install their most use web apps at the homescreen for quick access and ease of use without any complicated installation process.</li>

              <h2>What is Semafloor?</h2>
              <p>
                It is a meeting room booking web app which built with the notion of Progressive Web App (PWA) in mind and is fulfilled with all the guidelines needed to build a PWA.
                The name of the web app came from the term <em><a href="https://goo.gl/du0w9r" target="_blank">semaphore</a></em> in computer programming which is defined as a variable or abstract data type that is used for controlling access to some resource.
                The term semaphore is kind of closely resembling how a meeting room booking application works. For example, semaphore controls access from certain sources to some resources just like booking a room. You can only book an empty room when it is available to be reserved otherwise wait for it to be available again or search for other empty ones.
                The name changes over the course of the developement of this web app, it is eventually named Semafloor from the term semaphore.

            <p>
              In this section, we're going to walk you through some of the vital web technologies used that made this PWA possible.
              To build a PWA, you might only need some frontend rendering however in this PWA, it is noteworthy to cover the backend that pieces everything together.
              First and foremost, it seems to make sense to begin with the foundation of the library (namely Polymer) in this PWA - <a href="http://webcomponents.org/">Web Components</a>.
            </p>
            <h2>What is Web Components?</h2>
            <p>
              <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components">
                Web Components are a set of standards currently being produced by Google engineers as a W3C specification that allow for the creation of reusable widgets or components in web documents and web applications. The intention behind them is to bring component-based software engineering to the World Wide Web. The components model allows for encapsulation and interoperability of individual HTML elements.
              </blockquote>

              Web Components basically comprises of 4 fundamental elements:
              <ul>
                <li><span>Custom Elements</span> - To enable users to define their own new types of DOM elements which are built with the notion of reusability and encapsulation in mind.</li>
                <li><span>HTML Imports</span> - A new way to include and reuse the new defined types of DOM elements.</li>
                <li><span>Templates</span> - A standard DOM-based approach for client-side templating which means a content fragment is delcared and parsed at page load but can subsequently be instantiated for later use.</li>
                <li><span>Shadow DOM</span> - a way to encapsulate new defined DOM elements and remain separated from the DOM of the main document.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>What is Polymer?</h2>
            <p>
              It is a library designed to make creating reusable custom elements easier and quicker for developers.
              <br><br>
              So what makes Polymer differentiate from building custom elements using mere vanilla JS?
              <br><br>
              In Polymer, it provides developers a set of great tools and features such as two-way data binding and property observation to help developers creating custom elements much more powerful and reusable with lesser development time.
              It's like adding another layer of abstraction to Web Components and developers only need to learn some basic stuffs Polymer provides which makes creating reusable custom elements easier and faster and you're good to go.
            </p>
            <h2>Besides Polymer, what else? Lodash!</h2>
            <p>
              In a nutshell, Lodash is a powerful Javascript utility library that provides developers or might be you hundreds of functions that could reduce whole lot of boilerplate codes that one might be writing it everytime for a new function.
              Whenever you try reinventing the wheel, you should first check if that has already existed in Lodash before writing it.
              <br><br>
              Lodash focuses on modularity, performance, compatibility and many more.
              Speaking of compatibility, it works on both client side cross platform and server side.
              <br><br>
              With Lodash, it not only helps reduce the amount of boilerplate codes needed and improves the readability of the overall application meantime assures the developer optimization plus much more consistent performance across different platforms as even Native VanillaJS implemented in major moderen browsers might not always be the fastest.
            </p>
            <h2>Anything else being left out? Service Worker!</h2>
            <p>
              Service worker is a script that is run by the browser in the background separated by the web page to intercept the network request and manage the caching of all responses.
              <br><br>
              Service worker provides a better offline experience to a web app which gives developers full controls over that experience by enabling caching necessarily critical resource assets.
              Service worker is trying to tackle offline by getting rid of the 'offline dino' (which you can find it on Chrome during offline) as not all users don't always using the webapp or website on a consistent and stable network espcially on mobile networks are sometimes spotty.
              In other words, service workers allows a web app to be able to work offline just like a Native app as long as all static site contents have been cached with service workers.
              <br><br>
              Not only that, service worker does provide other features such as push notification. Push notification allows developers to re-engage their users with new updates or contents provided the users have opted in for receiving notification.
              <br><br>
              The feature has been implemented on Native platforms but was missing from the Web for very long time. Good news is that as of Chrome version 42 and Firefox version 44, push notification has been a thing on modern browsers by fulfilling some of the requirements to enable that amazing feature.
              In order to enable push notification, first a webapp or website must include a <b>Web App Manifest</b>, must <b>serve content via HTTPS</b> and have <b>Service worker enabled</b>.
              However, developers are required to register for <b>Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)</b> API as push messaging on Chrome only works with GCM as of now.
            </p>
            <h2>Last but not least... Firebase!</h2>
            <p>
              Firebase is a cloud service backend which provides a series of services like real time database, authentication using OAuth, and web hosting.
              <br><br>
              This PWA uses two of the main services that Firebase provides: <b>real time database</b> and <b>authentication</b>.
              <br><br>
              The great thing about Firebase is that data in your Firebase database is stored as and sent as JSON and always stays in sync to every users connected to the same database.
              When one user modifies the database, the rest of the users will receive the instant updates and all those are managed by Firebase in the background for you as in updating and synchronizing database and managing all the connection from different users, etc.
              All data being transmitted to and fro over a <b>secured SSL connection</b> and more granular controls at the database are also at the owner's disposal by using Firebase's <b>Security Rules</b>.
              <br><br>
              One last point worth noting is that all modification to the Firebase database works offline. For example, the connection disconnected in the midst of updating the newest data to the Firebase. This would not affect the synchronizing to the Firebase backend as those changes will be updated and synchronized with the current server state once the connection is re-established.
              <br><br>
              Here comes the authentication part with Firebase. As you might know operating your own backend to handle the authentication would definitely be a headache to a lot of developers, with Firebase Authentication, not only it supports authentication with some of the major websites such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc, it has all built-in functionality where developers can easily integrate it into their app just in a few lines of code and it works on both client side and server side.
              <br><br>
              However, as for general purpose, this PWA only implemented authentication with Google account.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's time for another section about what is involved in building the backend that powers some of the great features of the PWA.
              Here's a simplified list of the technologies and services used that made this PWA possible:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Nginx</b> - an open source HTTP Web server and reserve proxy server to power up the web app and serve the static contents.</li>
                <li><b>NodeJS</b> - an open source, cross platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications.</li>
                <li><b>Express</b> - a Node.js web application server framework, designed for building single-page, multiple page web applications.</li>
                <li><b>Firebase</b> - cloud service backend which provides a series of services like real time database, authentication using OAuth, and web hosting.</li>
                <li><b>HTTP/2</b> - the next version of HTTP and is based on Google's SPDY.</li>
                <li><b>Let's Encrypt</b> - a free, automated, and open certificate authority.</li>
                <li><b>Cloudflare</b> -  a content delivery network and distributed domain name server services, acting as a reverse proxy for websites.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Nginx - the backbone that powers everything!</h2>
            <p>
              People often ask why use Nginx? My response to that question is always: Why not Nginx?
              <br><br>
              One main point of using Nginx is that Nginx is based on the event-driven (asynchronous) architecture (EDA).
              It simple means that an EDA based server is capable of handling a number of clients with lesser threads compared to the conventional way (one thread per client).
              <br><br>
              Since an event based system will mean that the CPU utilization will be at its optimum as there will be no I/O blocking during execution of tasks as the CPU needs not to wait until the response, be it a network request or reading data from certain source is completed and is able to continue to execute other tasks while waiting for the response. When the response is completed, the tasks can be continued from the paused state and so on.
              That can greatly improves the overall performance of the web servers with much more effective use of system resources.
              <br><br>
              Besides that, there are a few more great features that Nginx possess to make it even more powerful such as load balancing, easy configuration, etc.
            </p>
            <h2>NodeJS</h2>
            <p>
              In this case, NodeJS seems to behave somewhat like Nginx. NodeJS is also event-based and asynchronous, non-blocking.
              <br><br>
              NodeJS is designed to have only a single thread per process and is able to interleave multiple activities for multiple parallel workflows, running those are synchronous while waiting for asynchronous response to complete.
              With this kind of design, NodeJS is able to run a large number of tasks and to handle multiple connections simultaneously just like Nginx.
              <br><br>
              Worth to note that, NodeJS can be used to run a web server too. However for some technical reasons, it is acceptable and preferable to run Nginx to reverse proxy the connection to NodeJS for task execution.
            </p>
            <h2>Express</h2>
            <p>
              Express is a light-weight web application framework that provides a set of features for building a web application, from managing routes, to handling requests and views.
              <br><br>
              Although these can be done with NodeJS, Express brings those tedious tasks to the next level by simplifying complicated and reduces boilerplate codes that need to run over and over again.
              Express plays an important role in handling routing for the backend in this case.
            </p>
            <h2>Firebase</h2>
            <p>
              As this has been discussed in the last section, it is going to briefly explain why Firebase is used here.
              Since Firebase can be run on both client and server side to handle real time database processing and custom authentication.
              <br><br>
              It is used at the backend to do filtering and querying from incoming request and send the response back.
            </p>
            <h2>HTTP/2</h2>
            <p>
              It is already year 2016. It is getting more and more websites hopping in to the upgrading to adopting HTTP/2.
              <br><br>
              And this may strike you in the mind: Why use HTTP/2?
              Well, It's been over 6 years since HTTP/1.1 which was first drafted in 1999 and the web has changed drastically over the years.
              <br><br>
              It's time to change the standard to make a better web especially for the mobile web.
              These are the major improvements in HTTP/2:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Single connection</b> - only one connection to the server, no more setting up multiple TCP connections to the user from just one connected client for data transmission.</li>
                <li><b>Header Compression</b> - HPACK compression to greatly reduce header overhead.</li>
                <li><b>Multiplexing</b> - With HTTP/1.1, only one transfer can happen at a time and it must wait for the previous one to complete. With HTTP/2, this is no longer the case, multiple requests are allowed at the same time, on the same connection.</li>
                <li><b>Priotization</b> - High priority requests will be sent first.</li>
                <li><b>Server Push</b> - Additional predicatable resource assets can be send in advance before the user even requests for it.</li>
                <li><b>Binary</b> - Makes HTTP/2 easier for a server to parse, more compact and less error-prone.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Let's Encrypt</h2>
            <p>
              While HTTP/2 supports both secure and non-secure connections, major browser vendors Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome will only support HTTP/2 over HTTPS.
              As this is no longer a performance issue of sort in HTTP/2 for implementing secured connections, this actually is great move towards a more secure web for a greater future of web.
              <br><br>
              Fortunately, there is a new initiave named Let's Encrypt just went public beta on December 3, 2015 to help providing free and certified security certificates to encourage people to embrace HTTPS.
              <br><br>
              Let's Encrypt aims to bring a more secured web meantime to tackle problems found in registering for a certificate and setting up for a secured website which has been a truly complicated process.
            </p>
            <h2>Cloudflare</h2>
            <p>
              Speaking of secured connection, besides Let's Encrypt, there is another initiative has you covered, Cloudflare.
              <br><br>
              Cloudflare offers basic Free plans to the public with some easy setup steps to secure the connection to the server.
              This includes free SSL certificate and the connection established in between the visitors and the server is HTTP/2 based which ensures better performance.
              <br><br>
              Cloudflare also provides some great features to accelerate your web page such as optimizing the web contents before sending it to the visitors, cache static contents, various support Cloudflare Apps for traffic and stats monitoring, threat protection as well content delivery network (CDN) service so that the site contents can be served to the visitors from the nearest datacenter.
